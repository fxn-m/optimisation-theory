# optimisation-theory
Linear (Simplex method), Non-Linear (Conjugate Gradient Descent), and Dynamic Programming Problem solvers with sample problems to solve for

# motivation
As part of EMAT30670 - Optimisation Theory and Applications (University of Bristol) 3 assignments were set to implement methods covered in class. This repo covers my submissions.

# using the solvers
Refer to the readme.txt file in each folder to get a better understanding of how to run the solvers
